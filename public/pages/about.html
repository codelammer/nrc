The Centre for Research in Spinal Health and Rehabilitation Medicine (CRSHRM) in partnership with Rehab professional societies are seeking support in strengthening rehabilitation services in Kenya’s public health system. This is in response to World Health Organization’s (WHO) Rehab 2030 initiative that aims to enhance awareness, advocacy and improve the capacity for rehabilitation in public health systems. To achieve this, CRSHRM-Department of Physiotherapy, College of Health Sciences, JKUAT is leading the planning and organization of a conference dubbed, ‘National Rehabilitation Conference’, (NRC2021) to be held on October 25-29, 2021 at the KICC, Nairobi Kenya. The conference will bring together patients/clients, healthcare providers, rehab professionals, academia, medical service providers, Research and Development institutions, the private sector, faith-based institutions, and state actors. There will be multi-disciplinary pre-conference rehabilitation courses focusing on spinal health, pediatrics rehab, orthotics and prosthetics, lympho-vascular rehab, disability, speech-language & audiology, mental rehab, and health systems strengthening for rehab. The conference covers five (5) thematic areas important for quality rehabilitation: The typical rehab journey for Kenyan patients; Partnerships and collaboration for rehab, Professional ethics and welfare, Rehab training, education, and research capacity, and Research and innovation in rehab. NRC 2021 is organized in form of rehab training courses, plenary presentations, panel and round-table discussions, breakout sessions/caucus, professional counseling sessions, exhibitions, benchmarking visits, an award ceremony, and a networking gala dinner. Strengthening rehabilitation calls for enhanced coordination and synergies with stakeholders to optimize their roles in health sector advancement. CRSHRM and her partners call upon like-minded organizations to join hands in planning and hosting the first National Multi-Disciplinary Rehab Conference in Kenya either by way of donation, sponsorship, a long-term the partnership agreement, or any other suitable means.
